## ⚠️ Important: Google Analytics Configuration

**If you're using this portfolio template, you MUST configure Google Analytics:**

The analytics script is **domain-protected** - it only works on `oktayshakirov.com`. 

To use your own analytics:
1. Open `assets/js/modules/analytics.js`
2. Replace `G-G1H2WJ7XH4` with your own Google Analytics Tracking ID
3. Update `AUTHORIZED_DOMAINS` array with your domain(s)

**This prevents traffic from copied portfolios from being counted in the original owner's analytics.**

## ⚠️ Important: Attribution Notice

**This portfolio includes an attribution footer that must remain visible.**

- **DO NOT remove or modify the attribution** - doing so will break website functionality
- The attribution is an integral part of the codebase and removing it will cause errors
- If you wish to use this portfolio **without attribution**, please contact me:
  - **Email:** info@oktayshakirov.com
  - **LinkedIn:** [oktayshakirov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oktayshakirov)

**Attempting to remove the attribution may result in broken functionality and is not recommended.**
