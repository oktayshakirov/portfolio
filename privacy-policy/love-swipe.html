            <p>
              We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any

            <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>
              We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The
              information we may collect via the Application depends on the
              content and materials you use, and includes:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect any personal

            <p>
              We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you use

              You can opt-out of personalized advertising by visiting Google's
              Ad Settings:
              <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank"
                >https://www.google.com/settings/ads</a
